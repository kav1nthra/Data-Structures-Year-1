## 🌟 Repository Overview
This repository contains the work I’ve done over the course of my DSA Lab – from classic linked lists to powerful graph algorithms

## 📌 Why C++ for DSA?

C++ is fast, powerful, and precise — everything you need when solving problems that rely on performance and memory control. With Standard Template Library (STL), pointers, and fine-grained data control, C++ gives you a strong foundation to implement real-world DSA solutions and understand what’s happening under the hood.

## 🧠 What Are Computational Problems?

Computational problems are the "what" behind most of computer science — how to store data, retrieve it, sort it, traverse it, and make decisions based on it. Whether it's finding the shortest path, matching patterns, or optimizing resources, every problem can be broken down into smaller logical steps. DSA is the toolkit we use to build those solutions efficiently and effectively.
