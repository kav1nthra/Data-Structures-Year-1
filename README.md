## üåü Repository Overview

This repository captures my lab work and exploration in Data Structures & Algorithms using C++. From writing the first array sort to exploring graphs and their powerful algorithms, this is my hands-on journey through core computational concepts.

## üìå Why C++ for DSA?

C++ is fast, powerful, and precise ‚Äî everything you need when solving problems that rely on performance and memory control. Its Standard Template Library (STL), pointers, and system-level control make it a strong tool to implement real-world DSA solutions and understand what‚Äôs happening under the hood.

## üß† What Are Computational Problems?

Computational problems are the challenges computers solve by processing data logically and efficiently. Whether it's finding the shortest route between two cities, matching text patterns, or balancing loads ‚Äî every solution requires smart data organization and algorithmic strategies. DSA is the toolbox we use to crack these problems in optimal time and space.
